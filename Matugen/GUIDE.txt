## Matugen Only Installation Guide

### Customizing Theme Settings:

You can modify the theme's settings directly from the `Settings.qml` file located in this directory. After making your desired changes, run Matugen to apply the new colors, background, and settings.

### Applying SDDM Theme Settings (Standalone):

To apply only the SDDM theme settings, you can execute the `sddm-theme-apply.sh` script with superuser privileges:

```bash
sudo ~/.config/hypr/custom/scripts/ii-sddm-theme/sddm-theme-apply.sh
```

### Advanced SDDM Configurations:

For additional customization options, please review the `ii-sddm.conf` file in this directory. Note that to apply any changes made to this file, you will still need to run matugen or the sddm-theme-apply.sh script
